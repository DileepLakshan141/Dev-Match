User Auth - Signup & Signin
------------------------------------------------

install "brcyptjs" and "@types/brcyptjs" packages.

create module, service and controller for auth using nest CLI (now you know the commands)

also make sure to add the AuthService in exports array of the AuthModule 

create user module and service as well

steps
--------
1. find the user service and inside imports array add our entity repository so we can inject it.

2. find the auth module and in imports array add the UsersModule otherwise we cant use it

3. inside the auth controller create the post endpoint "signup" 

4. inject the user repository to user service and implement create function inside user service

5. what happen is when we call auth controller signup endpoint it call the user service create function.
