Services 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Providers, which can inject to another class.
Responsible for,
    1. Fetch from DB
    2. Insert into DB

This service can be injected into controllers (one or multiple)

Services can be exported and used in another module
(it is a class with injectable decorator)

import {Injectable} from '@nestjs/common'

@Injectable()
export class SongService{

}

injecting the service
---------------------

@Controller('songs')
export class SongController{
    constructor(private songsService: SongService)
}

generating service
---------------------

use CLI command
"nest generate service [your-service-name]"

another important thing is the created service should be mentioned in providers
array of module.ts file(it will be automatically if we use CLI)
