Modules
------------------------------------------

1.Nest JS modules contains following concepts
    a.Providers
    b.Controllers
    c.Imports
    d.Exports


Providers
-----------
Providers in nest js are classes that act as services, factories or repositories
they encapsulate business logic and can be injected to controllers or other services.

Controllers
-----------
It serve the function of handling incoming http requests and sending responses back.
When we create a new endpoint it need to be registered inside the controller.

Imports
-----------
This is an array which hold all the external modules which requires to run the current
module. Enabling code reusability and seperation of concerns.

Exports
-----------
Utilized to make services are available for other modules.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Our application will have a root module. Which is specific to nest js framework.

Root module is the entry point and responsible for instantiating controllers
providers and other core elements of the app.

Nest architecture follow the concept of "Module Isolation" ensuring application 
is oraganized based on distinct functional based features.

@Module({
    imports:[SongModule]
    controllers:[AppController]
    providers:[AppProvider]
})

export class AppModule

1. Generating Modules
--------------------------------
You can use the CLI for this. command is,
"nest generate module [your-module-name]"

2. Generating Controllers
--------------------------------
Use the CLI for this as well. command is,
"nest generate controller [your-controller-name]"

Part B - API ENDPOINTS
---------------------------------------

1. GET requests

    a. get all songs (for an example refer song directory for codes)

    For this we need to import @Get decorator from @nestjs/common

    in your controller body

    @Get()
    findAllSongs(){
        return []
    }

    b. Getting specific song by sending route param

    @Get(':id')
    findAllSongs(@Param('id') id:string){
        return []
    }

    c. Using query params

    @Get()
    filterSongs(@Query('artist') artist:string){
        return []
    }

2. POST requests
    created with @Post decorator

3. PUT requests
    created with @Put decorator

4. DELETE requests
    created with @Delete decorator
