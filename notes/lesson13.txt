CRUD Operations
----------------------------------

for every typeorm entity, it provides an repository.
this repo has crud features.

steps
-------
1. first you have to register type orm module as a feature for into the relevant module
in this case it is "Song" as follows

imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Song])],

2.then we need to inject songs repository.
this forFeature method defines which repos are registered to current scope

go to songService and use the decorator @InjectRepository()

constructor(
    @InjectRepository(Song) private songRepository: Repository<Song>,
  ) {}

async create(songDTO: CreateSongDTO): Promise<Song> {
    const song = new Song();
    song.title = songDTO.title;
    song.releasedDate = songDTO.released;
    song.duration = songDTO.duration;
    song.artists = songDTO.artists;
    song.lyrics = songDTO.lyrics;

    return await this.songRepository.save(song);
  }

  how create method is looks like

4. update the controller as follows

@Post()
  createSong(@Body() createSongDTO: CreateSongDTO): Promise<Song> {
    return this.songsService.create(createSongDTO);
  }

that the create operation, when it comes to the find all
we can use findAll() method

to find specific one findOneBy()

to update update()

to delete delete()
