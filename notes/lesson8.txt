Custom Validation Pipes
---------------------------------------------

there are various types  of providers.

providers:[
    {
        provide: SongsService
        useclass: SongsService
    }
]

we need to use it as a class when inject into another class. alternate way to mention providers

1. Value providers
----------------------

When you need to create a mocking service instead of the actual service

providers:[
    {
        provide: SongsService,
        useValue: MockSongsService
    }
]

(replacing real implementation with mock object)

2. Non class based providers
----------------------------------------------

export const connection: connection = {
  CONN_STRING: 'string',
  DB: 'string',
  DB_NAME: 'string',
};

type connection = {
  CONN_STRING: string;
  DB: string;
  DB_NAME: string;
};


think this is an object we need to inject. definietly you can use a value provider method
for inject this considering it as a constant 

provider:[
    {
        provide: 'CONNECTION',
        useValue: connection
    }
]

next go to your service (in this case it is song service), find constructor
